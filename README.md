# Zetton 
> **⚠ Active Development**: Zetton is in active alpha development. Core analysis commands are functional with real output. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for current status.

## Quantum Software Reverse Engineering Framework

A next-generation reverse engineering framework that combines classical binary analysis with quantum computing algorithms. Zetton bridges the gap between traditional tools like Ghidra and the emerging capabilities of quantum computers for enhanced cryptanalysis and pattern detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and required system packages:
```bash
# On Kali Linux / Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv build-essential git
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keebanvillarreal/zetton.git
cd zetton
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment
**⚠ Important**: On Kali Linux and modern Debian-based systems, you **must** use a virtual environment to avoid the "externally-managed-environment" error.
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv zetton-env

# Activate it
source zetton-env/bin/activate
```
Your prompt should now show `(zetton-env)` indicating the environment is active.

#### 3. Install Zetton
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install Zetton in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install with all optional features (recommended)
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

#### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check version
zetton --version

# View the banner and available commands
zetton

# Check system status
zetton status
```
You should see output confirming Zetton v0.1.0 is installed.

## Quantum Algorithms

| Algorithm | Application | Theoretical Speedup |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Grover's Search | Pattern matching, constant finding | O(√N) |
| Quantum Counting | Solution estimation | O(√N) |
| QAOA | SAT solving, constraint optimization | Problem-dependent |
| VQE | Ground state problems | Exponential (certain cases) |
| Quantum Walks | Graph traversal in CFG | O(√N) |

### Quantum Backend Modes

1. **Simulation Mode** (Default): Local quantum simulation using Qiskit Aer. Best for development and testing.
2. **Hybrid Mode**: Classical preprocessing with quantum acceleration for specific subtasks. Optimal balance of practicality and capability.
3. **Hardware Mode**: Real quantum hardware via IBM Quantum or AWS Braket. For problems beyond classical simulation capacity.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "externally-managed-environment"**
```
Solution: Always use a virtual environment on Kali/Debian systems
→ python3 -m venv zetton-env && source zetton-env/bin/activate
```

**Error: "No module named 'zetton.cli'"**
```
Solution: Make sure the zetton package directory has cli.py and __init__.py
→ ls zetton/cli.py zetton/__init__.py
```

**Error: "command not found: zetton"**
```
Solution: Reinstall after activating virtual environment
→ source zetton-env/bin/activate
→ pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

**Module import errors (rich, click, qiskit)**
```
Solution: These should auto-install, but if not:
→ pip install click rich qiskit qiskit-aer
```

**LIEF RuntimeWarning about segment types**
```
This is a known LIEF 0.17 compatibility issue and is suppressed automatically.
It does not affect analysis results.
```
